# BMI-Comparison-

 Write a function that takes different parameters and creates a person object. The parameters would be:
-        Name
-        Height
-        Weight
-        BMI (initially null)
It would also contain a method to calculate BMI of the person if the BMI is currently null, and set the new BMI. And also, another function to compare BMI with another person.
Now, from user’s take inputs (prompt function) and create 2 persons. Show their individual BMI. And also demonstrate the compare function. The compare function should output something similar to this: “(Name1)’s BMI is greater than (Name2)’s”. Also, consider the fact that both BMI can be the same.
